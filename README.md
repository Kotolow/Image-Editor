# Image-Editor
This is a simple image editor, made with C++/Qt, which can:
1) importinging and displaying the loaded image - loading is performed only after the operator himself selects the desired image (interactive mode);
2) converts the loaded image to a monochrome image with the following conditions:
◦ automatic selection of contrast and color shades;
◦ the operator himself sets the contrast and color shades;
3) resizing the canvas loaded with the image, prompting the operator to crop part of the image;
4) automatic detection of the color palette of the image;
5) interactive change of the color palette of the image with the ability to preview the changes made;
6) saving all changes to a new image file with the ability to specify the name of the file and its output format (PNG, JPEG, JPG).
